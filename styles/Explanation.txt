Hi,

If you ever want to make your own style, please read this carefully before.

Make a new folder named by your style. Then create subfolders for the images and for the css.

Make your own template page on two parts (header.php and footer.php). Your header.php should start at the <body> part.

Images should be linked in this format <img src="styles/<?php echo $user_style;?>/images/test.gif">
And the links to indexes like this <a href="index.php"><?php echo "$lgMINDEX";?></a>

Don't forget to had somewhere the <?php include("styles/selectlanguages.php");?> and <?php include("styles/selectstyles.php");?> options.

"yourheader" is used for your personnal need (eg: Google Analytics script). The "globalheader" file shouldn't be touched nor "selectstyles" and "selectlanguages".

Well overhall, i guess it's more talking to take a look on the examples ;)

If you ever been stuck in a theme, you must delete your website's cookie user_style.

Jean-Marc
